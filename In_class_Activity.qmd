## Attitude dataset

The attitude data set in R contains survey responses from 30 employee rating aspects of their environment and management. The data includes variables such as "rating", "complaints" "learning", "raises" and others.

We will use ggplot2 to visualize the distribution of overall employee ratings and examines how the handling of complaints relates to learn, raises, and overall rating of their organization.

```{r}
# I got attitude data
data <- attitude
library(ggplot2)

# Make a histogram for distributin of employee ratings.
ggplot(data, aes(x = rating)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, fill = "#0073C2FF", color = "white") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Employee Ratings",
       x = "Overall Rating",
       y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal()

# Complaint vs. Privelage
ggplot(data, aes(x = complaints, y = privileges)) +
  geom_point(size = 3, color = "#EFC000FF") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = TRUE, color = "darkblue") +
  labs(title = "Handling of Complaints vs. Perceived Privileges",
       x = "Handling of Complaints",
       y = "Privileges") +
  theme_minimal()
```
